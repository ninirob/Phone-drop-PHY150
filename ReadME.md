# READ ME - Physics 150 Project: Phone Drop Simulation with Different Case Materials

## Files:
- **phone_drop_calculations.py**  
  For equation and data calculations.
- **phone_drop_diagram.py**  
  For diagrams to analyze data for which phone case is best for protection.

## Setup and Requirements
1. **Python Version:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. **Libraries:** The following libraries are required:
   - `matplotlib` for plotting graphs and visualizations.  
     You can install the required libraries using:
     ```bash
     pip install matplotlib
     ```
3. **Running the Code:**
   - Save the code as `phone_drop_simulation.py` and run it in your Python environment.
   - Example Output:
     The console output will display the velocity before impact, deceleration, and impact force for each case material. The graphical output will show the phone drop simulation and a collision time comparison bar chart.

## Overview
This project simulates the physics of a phone dropping from a height of 1.5 meters with different case materials:  
**phone only**, **silicone**, **hard plastic**, and **rubber**.  
The simulation calculates:
- The velocity just before impact
- Deceleration upon hitting the ground
- The impact force
- The collision time for each material

The data is visualized through graphical plots, including the forces at play and a bar chart comparing collision times, to determine which phone case is best for protection.

## Project Details

### Constants
- **Acceleration due to gravity:** `g = 9.8 m/sÂ²`
- **Height of the drop:** `h = 1.5 m`

### Calculations

#### 1. **Velocity before Impact**
The velocity before impact is calculated using the following formula derived from the kinematic equations of motion:

v = \sqrt{2gh} 

Where:
- `g = 9.8 m/sÂ²` (acceleration due to gravity)
- `h = 1.5 m` (height of the drop)

#### 2. **Deceleration**
The deceleration for each phone (depending on the collision time) is calculated using the following equation:

a = \frac{v}{t} 

Where:
- `v` is the velocity before impact
- `t` is the collision time

#### 3. **Force of Impact**
The force of impact is calculated using Newton's second law:

F = ma

Where:
- `m` is the mass of the object (in kg)
- `a` is the deceleration (in m/sÂ²)

#### 4. **Time of Flight**
The time of flight is the time it takes for the object to fall, and it's calculated using:

t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} 

Where:
- `h = 1.5 m` (height)
- `g = 9.8 m/sÂ²` (acceleration due to gravity)

## Results

For each material, the velocity before impact, deceleration, and force of impact are calculated as follows:

### Phone Only:
- Mass = `0.176 kg`
- Force of impact: `95.30 N`

### Silicone Case:
- Mass = `0.224 kg`
- Force of impact: `24.29 N`

### Hard Plastic Case:
- Mass = `0.207 kg`
- Force of impact: `37.40 N`

### Rubber Case:
- Mass = `0.266 kg`
- Force of impact: `18.06 N`

The time of flight for all cases is `0.553 s`.

### Impact Forces
- **Gravity Force:** The force acting due to gravity.
- **Impact Force:** The force experienced when the phone hits the ground.

### Collision Times
The bar chart shown above compares the collision times for different materials.
